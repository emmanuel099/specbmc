Bounded (software) model checker for speculative non-interference.

`specbmc` automatically detects Spectre-PHT and Spectre-STL vulnerabilites in binary programs.

![specbmc](doc/cli.gif)

Please note that `specbmc` has been implemented as part of my Master's Thesis and is therefore not considered "production ready".

This work has been inspired by [Spectector](https://spectector.github.io/).

## Usage

Input files are currently limited to ÂµASM files and ELF binaries.

### Environment File

Almost everything of `specbmc` can be configured via the environment file.
An environment file can be loaded via the `--env` command-line option.
Please note that command-line arguments have precedence over environment settings,
meaning that if the environment contains e.g. `optimization: full` but the option `-o none` is given, no optimization will be done.
It is required that the environment file is a valid YAML file.

#### Available options (for missing options the specified default value will be used):

```yaml
# LIR optimization level: none, basic, full [default: full]
#   - none: no optimizations
#   - basic: copy propagation
#   - full: constant folding & propagation, expression simplification and copy propagation
optimization: full

# SMT solver: z3, cvc4, yices2 [default: yices2]
solver: yices2

# Analysis
analysis:
  # Search for Spectre-PHT? false, true [default: true]
  spectre_pht: true
  # Search for Spectre-STL? false, true [default: false]
  spectre_stl: false
  # Type of leak check: only_transient_leaks, only_normal_leaks, all_leaks
  #                     [default: only_transient_leaks]
  #   - only_transient_leaks: Only find leaks which are there because of transient execution
  #   - only_normal_leaks: Find normal leaks (no transient execution)
  #   - all_leaks: Search for both types of leaks (transient + normal)
  check: only_transient_leaks
  # Branch prediction strategy: choose_path, invert_condition [default: choose_path]
  #   - choose_path: predict taken/not-taken
  #   - invert_condition: mis-predict (take the opposite)
  predictor_strategy: choose_path
  # The default number of loop iterations to unwind: n >= 0 [default: 0]
  unwind: 0
  # The number of loop iterations to unwind for specific loops (key is loop id, value is unwinding bound >= 0)
  # If no specific loop bound is given, the default unwinding bound is used instead.
  unwind_loop:
    ...
  # Add either unwinding assumptions or assertions: assumption, assertion [default: assumption]
  unwinding_guard: assumption
  # Recursion limit for recursive function-inlining: # n >= 0 [default: 0]
  recursion_limit: 0
  # Start with empty (flushed) cache? false, true [default: false]
  # Note: This option is currently only available when using the CVC4 solver.
  start_with_empty_cache: false
  # Type of observation: sequential, parallel, full [default: parallel]
  #   - sequential: Observe only at the end of the program.
  #                 Transient execution can resolve at any time.
  #   - parallel:   Observe each instruction and control-flow join.
  #                 Transient execution resolves only if speculation window is exceeded.
  #                 Much cheaper than `full` but may miss some special types of control-flow leaks,
  #                 see `test/window_branch_leak_size_three.muasm`.
  #   - full:       Same as parallel but transient execution can resolve at any time.
  #   - trace:      Same as parallel but full trace instead of individual observations.
  observe: parallel
  # Type of analysis model: components, pc [default: components]
  #   - components: Observe microarchitectual components like cache, branch-target buffer, ...
  #   - pc:         Observe program counter and memory loads (cheaper than components model)
  model: components
  # The program entry point: string [default: entry point from binary]
  program_entry: "main"
  # List of function names which should not be inlined
  inline_ignore: []

# Architecture
architecture:
  # Is cache available to attacker? false, true [default: true]
  cache: true
  # Is branch target buffer available to attacker? false, true [default: true]

```

#### Environment Auto-loading:

If the `--env` command-line option isn't set, `specbmc` will automatically search for a matching environment file in the directory where the input file `<FILE>` is located.
If no matching environment file could be found, the default values will be used instead.

By convention `specbmc` assumes that for an input file `{name}{extension}` an environment file `{name}.yaml` exists. For example, if the input file is `example.o` then `specbmc` will search for an environment file `example.yaml` in the same directory.
